## Contribute

  - Please use Shift-JIS encoding. To be more specific, use the encoding that
DOS on PC-9800 systems uses.
  - Please try to fit as many lines as possible into 80 characters. Exceptions
are:
    - The line with many contributors' names in the LICENSE file, since it's
necessary for GitHub to recognise it's an MIT license encoded with Shift-JIS;
    - A line with a URL, since otherwise it will be a pain to copy it.
  - Please fit the filenames of as many files as possible into the 8.3 filename
format.
  - Use space for indentation.
